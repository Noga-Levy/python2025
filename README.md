# python2025
With all these big projects coming in with deadlines like tsunamis, I figured I should have a small workspace to work on some smaller ones. Enter, python2025--my collections of the "little ones."

## Usage
Chock-full of my small, usually 1-file, Python projects, I like to compare this to a thrift shop: some nuggets here are gold, others... well, they aren't big projects for a reason. Or, more bluntly, 
they are half-baked and dysfunctional, but I still believe I'll get back to them one day. 

Take a look at them, and if you find anything useful, by all means, use it! However, please add a note as to where it came from. ðŸ˜‰

## Languages
**Python, Bash**

Despite what the project name suggests, there are more than just Python files here! There are a couple of experimental Bash scripts, too, as I wanted to give the scripting language a try.

## How they were made
Shower thoughts, mostly. Then a couple of hours of coding. Repeat, and you get this repository!
